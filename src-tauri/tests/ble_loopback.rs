//! Two BLE nodes, the real runtime, real sockets, no radio.
//!
//! # What this covers that the protocol tests do not
//!
//! `crates/cabal-ble` tests the protocol with a virtual clock and links that
//! are function calls. Everything there is decided in memory.
//!
//! This exercises the other half: a tokio task per node, a real transport
//! handing back real `LinkEvent`s, engine actions actually reaching a socket,
//! bytes actually coming back as events, timers actually firing on wall-clock
//! time. It is the wiring, and the wiring is where "the protocol is correct
//! but nothing happens" lives.
//!
//! # Why loopback rather than Bluetooth
//!
//! CI has no radio, and this machine cannot drive one from a test: on macOS a
//! process without an app bundle is refused Bluetooth by TCC, and an iOS
//! simulator does not virtualise CoreBluetooth at all.
//!
//! So the seam is [`LoopbackTransport`], and what remains unproven by this
//! file is stated rather than implied: advertising, scanning, L2CAP setup, MTU
//! behaviour and radio sleep are verified on two physical machines and
//! recorded in `docs/mobile-build-verification.md`, or they are not verified.
