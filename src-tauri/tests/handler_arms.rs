//! `lib.rs` registers exactly one invoke-handler arm, and it carries every
//! reshaped command.
//!
//! # The failure this exists for
//!
//! `run()` used to build two `generate_handler!` lists: one for desktop with
//! the frozen legacy surface, one for mobile without it. A command added to
//! the desktop arm and forgotten on the mobile one compiled, passed every
//! test, and was granted by `capabilities/mobile.json` — the ACL allowed it,
//! the command simply was not registered, so the invoke failed at runtime on
//! the phone and nowhere else. That is exactly what happened to `ble_status`:
//! granted, present in the generated ACL schema, and missing from the mobile
//! arm. The symptom was a panel that silently rendered nothing on device
//! while every test was green, and it cost a full simulator build to find.
//!
//! The legacy arm and its `desktop-legacy` feature are gone now — desktop and
//! mobile share one frontend and one handler — but the class of bug they
//! caused is worth guarding against permanently: this file fails loudly if a
//! second arm ever reappears, or if the one arm ever drops a command that
//! `build.rs` or a capability file still expects.
//!
//! # Why this reads the source
//!
//! A macro's contents are not introspectable at runtime, and building a mock
//! app proves only that the arm the test was compiled for exists. Reading
//! `lib.rs` is crude, and it is the only thing that actually checks this.
