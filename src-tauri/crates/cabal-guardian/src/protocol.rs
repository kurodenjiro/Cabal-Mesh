//! The message shapes exchanged over `PacketKind::Guardian` on the mesh.
//!
//! # Why an unlock request cannot simply be "sent to my guardians"
//!
//! BLE peer identifiers are ephemeral by design — a new one every launch,
//! deliberately, so a passive listener cannot follow a device across days
//! (see `cabal_ble::peers`'s module docs). That is also true of the *owner*
//! requesting an unlock and of the *guardian* who might answer: neither
//! knows the other's current identifier going in, only their durable public
//! key from enrollment.
//!
//! So [`UnlockRequest`] cannot be directed. It is broadcast, and it does not
//! name which guardians it is for — it carries one *unlinkable recognition
//! tag* per enrolled guardian ([`recognition_tag`]), each a keyed hash of
//! that guardian's public key and a fresh nonce. Anyone can see a request
//! went out; nobody but a holder of one of the matching public keys can tell
//! it was meant for them, and a guardian's response to two different
//! requests produces two unrelated tags even for the same owner. This is the
//! same shape as the durable-identity rule the mesh already enforces for the
//! AVAX address — nothing durable travels except as ciphertext or an
//! unlinkable derivative of it.
//!
//! A guardian who recognises a tag replies directly to the request's sender
//! — trivial, since that peer id is right there in the packet that just
//! arrived — with [`UnlockReply`], sealed to the *owner's* recovery public
//! key (also from enrollment). The owner never needs to know which of their
//! guardians a given reply came from; only that enough of them arrived.
