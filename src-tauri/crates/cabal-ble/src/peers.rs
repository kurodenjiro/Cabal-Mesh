//! Who is out there, how far, and for how long.
//!
//! # Announcements, and what is deliberately not in them
//!
//! bitchat's whitepaper names its own weakest point plainly: the sender
//! identifier in every packet derives from a key that never rotates, and
//! announcements carry the static public key and a nickname in cleartext. A
//! passive listener enumerates who is present and follows a device across
//! places and days.
//!
//! For an app whose first sentence is "you are a Nobody", shipping that would
//! contradict the product. So an announcement here carries **only this
//! session's ephemeral keys**. No nickname, no wallet address, no durable
//! identifier of any kind. The durable identity — the AVAX address the IP
//! plane already publishes — travels as ciphertext inside an established
//! session, never in the clear.
//!
//! What that costs is real and is not hidden: a peer traded with yesterday is
//! a stranger today until the handshake runs again.
//!
//! # Neighbour lists
//!
//! Each announcement carries up to ten of the sender's own direct neighbours.
//! That is how a node learns the shape of the mesh two hops out without a
//! routing protocol — enough to know a directed packet has somewhere to go,
//! and not enough to be a routing table worth attacking.
