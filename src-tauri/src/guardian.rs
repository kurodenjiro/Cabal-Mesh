//! Guardian enrollment and mesh unlock: persistence and orchestration around
//! `cabal_guardian`'s crypto core.
//!
//! See `docs/identity-design.md` for the design this implements, and the
//! module docs on `cabal_guardian::protocol` for why an unlock request is a
//! broadcast of unlinkable tags rather than something addressed by durable
//! identity — BLE peer ids reset every launch, and this mesh's own stated
//! rule is that nothing durable ever travels in the clear.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! The 24–48h recovery delay with a veto notification (decision 3 in the
//! design doc) is not implemented. It needs a background task and a local
//! notification that survive the app being closed, which is platform
//! integration work — real on iOS/Android, not something this file can
//! provide or verify without a physical device. What is here is everyday
//! unlock: guardians who are currently reachable, answering in real time,
//! which is also the doc's own "Unlock — owner side" mock-up.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! One encrypted document, holding both roles a device can play — the
//! guardians *it* has enrolled, and the shares it holds *for others* — since
//! a real device plausibly does both. Protected the same way the identity
//! vault is by default: a file-backed key. It does not yet participate in
//! `SECURITY`'s passphrase switch (`BlockchainBridge::enable_passphrase`);
//! wiring the two together is follow-up work, not silently assumed here.
