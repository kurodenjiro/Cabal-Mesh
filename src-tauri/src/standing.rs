//! This installation's private settlement history and trend.
//!
//! # What this replaces, and why the name changed
//!
//! Ticket 03 shipped a **mock** reputation score, derived from the peer
//! identifier so it would at least be stable. It was a number the product could
//! not back, and it was recorded as such at the time. Ticket 39 replaces it.
//!
//! The field is now called what it measures. `REPUTATION SCORE 87.6` was a
//! score with no scale, no inputs and no way for a user to ask why it was that
//! number. `INTENTS SETTLED 14 (+55.6%)` is a count anyone can verify by
//! looking at their own history, which is the only kind of trust signal a
//! product built on proving things can honestly show about itself.
//!
//! Renaming rather than redefining matters: keeping the label `REPUTATION
//! SCORE` over a settled-intent count would be the same dishonesty in a
//! different place — a figure whose name promises more than its definition
//! delivers.
//!
//! # Where the numbers come from
//!
//! The device-local ledger, which is the same place the intents list reads
//! from. There is no second local accounting to drift from the first.
//!
//! This is intentionally named [`LocalStanding`]. It is valid for the owner's
//! home/profile screens, but it is not public seller standing and must never be
//! sent to a marketplace buyer as evidence about another wallet. Public
//! marketplace standing is verified from the canonical on-chain registry by
//! `cabal-standing`; when that evidence is unavailable it reads `UNKNOWN`, not
//! this local count.
//!
//! - **The headline is lifetime**, not windowed. "How many have I settled" has
//!   one obvious answer and it is not "in the last week".
//! - **The delta compares the last seven days against the seven before it.**
//!   A real prior window, not a fabricated trend.
//!
//! # When there is no delta
//!
//! A node that settled nothing in the prior window has **no baseline**, and a
//! percentage change from zero is not a large number — it is undefined. The
//! delta is absent in that case, which `StatTile::plain` already renders as no
//! delta at all rather than as `+0.0%`.
//!
//! Zero settled intents is a different thing: that is a measured zero, and it
//! renders as `0`. The em dash was right when nothing was measured; it would be
//! wrong here, because this is measured and the answer is none.
