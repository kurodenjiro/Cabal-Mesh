//! Async orchestration wiring [`GuardianService`] to the BLE plane.
//!
//! Split from `guardian.rs` the same way `mesh_handle.rs` is split from
//! `mesh.rs`: the sync core holds persistence and protocol logic and is
//! cheap to test exhaustively; this file is the network glue, tested against
//! a real (loopback) transport in `tests/guardian_loopback.rs` rather than
//! with a mock, for the same reason `tests/ble_loopback.rs` exists — "the
//! protocol is correct but nothing happens" is a real failure mode that
//! in-memory tests cannot catch.
