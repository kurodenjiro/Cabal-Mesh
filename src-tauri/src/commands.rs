//! The reshaped command surface.
//!
//! Distinct from [`crate::legacy`], which is frozen. Commands here return
//! [`AppError`] rather than `String`, so the frontend switches on a variant
//! and renders its own copy.
//!
//! Screen commands land with their screens, in tickets 29 onward — never
//! speculatively, because an unreachable command still has to be granted a
//! permission, and a permission granted ahead of a caller is a permission
//! nobody is checking.

/// Stops delivery for a live stream.

/// **Cancels delivery, not the operation being reported on.** Leaving the
/// connecting screen does not disconnect the mesh; leaving the settled screen
/// does not abort an in-flight settlement. Aborting a domain operation is a
/// separate, explicit command — conflating the two would let a UI navigation
/// cancel a transaction.
///
/// Idempotent by design. The frontend races unmount against subscribe, so a
/// teardown for a handle that never landed is routine rather than exceptional,
/// and must not surface as an error the UI has to explain.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// None currently. It returns `Result` because every command on this surface
/// does, so adding a failure case later is not a breaking change for callers.
