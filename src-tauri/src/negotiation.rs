//! Local, autonomous price negotiation between buy and sell intents.
//!
//! # What runs where
//!
//! Every node runs its own copy of this: there is no matchmaker service, only
//! each device's own [`crate::intents::Ledger`] and whatever local Ollama
//! model it has configured. When an intent arrives from the mesh, this module
//! checks it against this device's *own* open intents for the opposite side
//! of the same asset. If the price ranges overlap, the local model proposes a
//! settlement price, and this device broadcasts a `DealAccepted` — the exact
//! wire message [`crate::intents::apply_mesh_event`] already knows how to
//! read, it just never had a sender before this.
//!
//! # Why the model is never trusted on the number
//!
//! The same rule [`crate::matcher`] follows: an LLM decides *which* price
//! within a range reads as fair, never *whether* a price is acceptable. The
//! proposed price is checked against the buyer's ceiling and the seller's
//! floor before anything is broadcast, and an unreachable or malformed
//! response falls back to a deterministic split rather than blocking the
//! match — the trade is real even when the model is not running.
//!
//! # What "confirmation" means on each side
//!
//! The buyer's confirmation is the existing `DealAccepted` handler in
//! `intents.rs`: it already sets a counterparty and moves the intent to
//! `Negotiating` the moment such a message arrives, which is what this module
//! now causes to happen. The seller's confirmation — this device, when it is
//! the one that matched — is set directly on its own ledger entry here,
//! since it needs no round trip to learn about a decision it just made.
