//! The device-bound half of the vault key.
//!
//! # What this is for, and what it is not
//!
//! The passphrase closes the at-rest hole: a copied key file is ciphertext.
//! This layer closes a different one — it makes that copied file useless *on
//! another machine*, even to someone who also learned the passphrase, because
//! part of the key never left the device it was made on.
//!
//! It is a layer **under** the passphrase, never a replacement for it. That
//! ordering is not stylistic. On every desktop key store that unlocks once per
//! session, any process running as this user can simply ask the store for the
//! item; a design that leaned on hardware alone would hand the key to exactly
//! the attacker the passphrase was introduced to stop.
//!
//! # What each platform actually provides
//!
//! | Platform | Store | Wired | What it buys |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | macOS, iOS | Keychain | yes | The secret is not in the app's files at all. A keychain ACL binds the item to the signed application, so on a signed build another process must prompt the user; on an unsigned or ad-hoc build it does not, and this module does not claim it does. |
//! | Android | Keystore / StrongBox | yes | The secret is encrypted under a non-exportable AES key held in StrongBox where the device has one and in the TEE otherwise. The blob travels with a copied file; the key that opens it cannot leave the device. See `tauri-plugin-cabal-keystore`. |
//! | Windows | TPM, DPAPI | **no** | DPAPI would add nothing against a same-user process, and a TPM-sealed secret is real work that has not been done. |
//! | Linux | — | n/a | No store that survives the headless case, which is why `keyring` was removed. Reported as absent. |
//!
//! # The honest limit
//!
//! Without a user-presence requirement, hardware binding stops *exfiltration*
//! rather than *access*: code running as this user, on this machine, while the
//! app can run, can still obtain the secret. Requiring presence on every
//! unlock is a product decision with a real cost, recorded as open in
//! `docs/identity-design.md` rather than made silently here.
