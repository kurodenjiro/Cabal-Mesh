//! The intent ledger — every intent this device has composed, and where it is.
//!
//! # Why the log lives here rather than in the streaming task
//!
//! Ticket 34's load-bearing rule is that **cancelling the settlement log must
//! not abort the settlement.** That is a correctness property with money
//! attached, and the only way to hold it reliably is structurally: the
//! settlement task writes into the ledger, and a subscription is a *reader*
//! that happens to be attached at the time. Dropping every reader changes
//! nothing about the writer.
//!
//! So lines are appended to the intent itself and fanned out to whoever is
//! listening, rather than being pushed straight down a channel. That also means
//! a subscriber arriving late replays what it missed instead of joining a
//! stream mid-sentence, which is what navigating back to a settling intent
//! does.
//!
//! # Why it persists
//!
//! An intent queued while offline has to survive the app being killed — that is
//! the entire promise of queue-then-drain. Writes go through [`cabal_store`],
//! which is crash-safe, after every mutation rather than on a timer: the
//! mutations are rare and small, and a timer would mean the one crash that
//! matters is the one that loses the queue.
//!
//! # Transitions are checked, not trusted
//!
//! [`IntentStatus::can_transition_to`] owns the rules. [`Ledger::advance`]
//! refuses anything it rejects rather than overwriting, so no caller can settle
//! something that was never broadcast by writing the field directly.
