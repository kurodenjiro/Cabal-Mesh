/// Declares every command this app exposes over IPC so Tauri generates an
/// `allow-*` / `deny-*` permission for each one.
///
/// Without a manifest, the app's own commands sit outside the ACL entirely.
/// Tauri 2.11.1 closed the hole where IPC from a remote origin bypassed access
/// control when no manifest was configured — but relying on the old behaviour
/// was never safe, and a declared manifest is what makes least privilege
/// expressible at all.
///
/// A generated permission does nothing until a capability references it, so
/// this list and `capabilities/desktop.json` (which now grants the same set
/// as `capabilities/mobile.json` — desktop and mobile share one frontend and
/// one handler in `lib.rs`) must stay in step. Declaring a command here
/// without granting it there makes the command unreachable.
