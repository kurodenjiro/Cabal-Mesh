# Chat intents, marketplace, and node modules — design

**Status: partially built.** Written 2026-08-10; updated 2026-08-13.

**Chat intent (below) is built** — `parse_intent_chat` fills the same form
fields `New.tsx` already validates through, unchanged.

**Marketplace and modules: the mechanism is written, nothing is deployed.**
Resolving the doc's four open questions surfaced a fifth, more urgent one:
`CabalMeshVoucher`, already deployed to Fuji, has **no access control on
minting at all** — anyone can call it directly and mint themselves any
module for free. `contracts/contracts/CabalMeshVoucher.sol` (fixed) and the
new `contracts/contracts/RelayRewards.sol` implement decisions 0–4 below,
with 37 passing Hardhat tests
(`contracts/test/{CabalMeshVoucher,Marketplace,RelayRewards}.test.ts`), and
the Rust bridge's ABI bindings already match them
(`src-tauri/abi/{CabalMeshVoucher,RelayRewards}.abi.json`). **None of it is
deployed to Fuji** — deploying replaces the live contract address the app
would eventually point at, which is a different kind of action than writing
code, and is waiting on a separate go-ahead. Also not built: the Rust-side
wiring that would make a real gateway relay actually call
`RelayRewards.recordGatewayRelay` (needs product decisions about fee
amount and gateway selection this doc doesn't make), and any
Marketplace/Modules UI (`VAULT → MODULES`, the MARKET tab).

Three connected changes: composing intents by conversation instead of by form,
a marketplace for NFTs, and NFTs that measurably improve what a node earns.

## Naming, deliberately

The frozen desktop RPG UI was deleted in 0a71f59 for being off-brand. This
design does **not** reintroduce it under another name. There is no inventory, no
loot, no potions.

The metaphor is **hardware modules slotted into a node** — which is both on-brand
for an instrument/terminal aesthetic and a literal fit for a mesh device.

## The loop

```
   relay traffic for peers  ──>  earn MB  ──>  earn AVAX
            ▲                                     │
            │                                     ▼
     modules raise the rate  <──  buy / sell on MARKET
            ▲                                     │
            └──────── mint at milestones ─────────┘
```

Modules are NFTs on `CabalMeshVoucher` (ERC721, already deployed to Fuji).
Three slots:

| Slot | Example modules | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| RADIO | Relay Amplifier, Range Extender | +% relay yield, more peers counted |
| CRYPTO | Ghost Cloak, Proof Accelerator | +privacy hops, cheaper/faster settlement |
| POWER | Gateway License | earn while acting as an internet gateway |
| — | Standing Badge | **soulbound**, earned by settling, not tradable |

Editable chips are what make a wrong parse cheap to fix without falling back to
a full form:

```
        tap [10 AVAX]
              ▼
┌─ AMOUNT ─────────────────────────────────┐

```

**The safety property from the current form is preserved exactly.** The model
only produces `IntentFields`. `parse_draft` still validates, `preview_intent`
still builds the review rows from the draft, and broadcasting still re-parses
the same fields. The AI proposes; Rust decides; the user confirms. The model
never broadcasts.

```

`★ 42` is the seller's **real** standing — settlement count from
`src/standing.rs`, not an invented score.

`Marketplace.sol` already implements the escrow this promises: `buy()` locks
AVAX and pulls the NFT into escrow, `releaseDeal` / `refundDeal` settle it.

Showing the bonus this specific module actually produced is what makes owning it
feel real rather than decorative.

## Five things, now settled

The doc originally listed four open questions. Answering them honestly
surfaced a fifth, more urgent one — decision 0 — that the other four
actually depend on. All five are grounded in the contracts and Rust as they
exist today (`contracts/contracts/*.sol`, `src-tauri/src/blockchain_bridge.rs`),
not as the earlier draft assumed.

**0. `CabalMeshVoucher.mintVoucher` has no access control — this blocks
everything else.** `contracts/contracts/CabalMeshVoucher.sol:25` declares it
`external` with no modifier: anyone, from any wallet, can call it directly
against the deployed Fuji contract and mint themselves a token with any
`voucherType` and `description` string they like, for free, right now — no
app involved. This is worse than the local-file risk decision 1 below
worries about: a farming defence built entirely at the app/relay layer
still means nothing while the mint entry point itself has no gate. Nothing
in decisions 1, 3 or 4 is meaningful until this is fixed.

**Decision: redeploy the voucher contract with minting restricted to a
single on-chain caller — the reward contract from decision 3, not an
off-chain admin key.** Restricting it to a *contract address* rather than a
person keeps the reward path trustless: a module is minted only as the
atomic side effect of a settlement this contract already verified on-chain,
never by a party's own say-so, off-chain or on. `CabalMeshVoucher` is a
plain `ERC721` with no `Ownable`, no proxy — not upgradeable — so this is a
new deployment, not a migration. Low-stakes to do now: Fuji testnet, no
value locked in the current contract yet.

**1. The old relay boost was a local JSON file, and it is still live dead
code.** `apply_relay_boost` / `get_relay_boost_multiplier` /
`relay_boost_path` were not deleted with the old RPG UI (`0a71f59` removed
only the frontend caller in `src/App.tsx`) — they are still sitting in
`blockchain_bridge.rs:841-852`, unreachable from any command today, ready
to be wired back up by exactly the mistake this doc warns against.

**Decision: delete them outright**, and compute the relay-yield multiplier
on demand from verified on-chain module ownership every time it's shown —
never cache or store it as an editable local value, in a file or anywhere
else.

**2. `CabalMeshVoucher` has no slot, rarity, or effect on-chain — and no
metadata hook to add them to.** The contract has no `tokenURI` override, no
`_baseURI`, no `ERC721URIStorage` — `tokenURI()` returns an empty string for
every token today. The doc's original "recommended route," off-chain
`tokenURI` metadata, is not achievable without a contract change either, so
it is not actually cheaper than the alternative.

**Decision: structured on-chain fields instead of a metadata URI** —
`VoucherData` gains `uint8 slot`, `uint8 rarity`, `uint16 effectBps` (the
module's effect as basis points, e.g. `1800` = +18%) alongside the existing
`voucherType`/`description`. Every other contract this app reads
(`IEscrow`, `IMarketplace`) is already read as typed on-chain calls through
`sol!` bindings, not as fetched JSON from a URI a host somewhere has to keep
serving — matching that pattern keeps one read path instead of two, and
keeps a module's effect something Rust can verify directly rather than
trust a metadata host to report honestly. `tokenURI` support for external
wallet/marketplace display is worth adding later; it is not the source of
truth either way.

**3. Who pays the relay reward, and for which kind of relay specifically?**
*(the question the rest depended on.)* The app relays two different ways,
and only one of them is currently attributable to a specific node at all.
BLE mesh relaying is flood-based — a packet is copied by whichever
neighbours a thinned fanout selects (`cabal-ble/src/router.rs`), with no
routing table and no single node identifiable as "the" relay for a given
hop. **Gateway relaying is different**: a gateway submits an offline node's
signed transaction to the chain itself, so the submitting address is
already on-chain and already attributable, no new protocol needed.

**Decision: relay rewards apply to gateway relaying only, for now** — a
sender-paid fee, not treasury emission (self-sustaining, no inflation to
fund), paid atomically out of the same settlement the relayed transaction
produces. `RELAYED TODAY` / `relay_bytes` on HOME stays honest in the
meantime: it is wired to `0` today (`mesh.rs`'s counter is initialized and
read but never incremented — the `0.0096 AVAX` mock-up was decoration
against a number that was already always zero), and should keep reading as
"not tracked yet" rather than fabricate BLE-relay activity a reward can't
actually attribute. Rewarding BLE flood relay is future work that needs a
protocol change first (an attributable per-hop receipt), not a reward-layer
decision.

**4. Farming defence.** With reward scope narrowed to gateway relay
(decision 3), the sybil case narrows with it: two devices owned by one
person forwarding junk to each other over BLE earns nothing either way,
because BLE relay isn't rewarded. What remains is a gateway paying itself
by fronting its own transactions — defended against by the mechanism
already required for payment to move at all: **the fee is deducted from a
real settlement** (`Escrow`/`Marketplace` releasing to a counterparty), so
"farming" it costs the same real AVAX moving between two real addresses
that self-dealing already costs anywhere else in this app, gateway or not.
No new signature/receipt scheme (`IntentAck`, reserved in the wire format
but never implemented — `cabal-ble/src/wire.rs:143`) is needed for v1. A
minimum settlement size or a same-address check between gateway and
counterparty is worth adding if v1 shows it is actually exploited; it is
not a blocker to start.
