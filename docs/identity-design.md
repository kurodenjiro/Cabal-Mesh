# Identity, unlock, and mesh recovery — design

**Status: partially built.** Written 2026-08-10; updated 2026-08-13 once the
first two layers below actually shipped. What follows was written when none
of it existed, and is kept as the design rationale — the parts now built
match it, the parts that don't are noted inline.

**Built and tested (including over a real, if loopback, transport — not just
in-memory):**
- **Passphrase unlock** (decision 1). `cabal_vault::PassphraseKeyProvider`
  (Argon2id), opt-in, off by default. `VAULT → KEYS → SECURITY` in the app.
- **Export / import / restore**, closing the "no way to export the key" gap
  this doc opened with. `VAULT → KEYS → ADVANCED`.
- **Guardian mesh unlock** (decisions 2–3's mechanism, minus the delay —
  see below): enrollment (request → accept → sealed share), a broadcast
  unlock request using unlinkable per-guardian tags rather than durable
  peer identifiers (see "Mesh unlock" below — the design needed one addition
  the original text didn't anticipate, spelled out where it's relevant), and
  an unlock reply gated on an explicit human approval tap, exactly as this
  doc specifies. `cabal_guardian` (crypto), `src/guardian.rs` (persistence +
  protocol), `src/guardian_actor.rs` (BLE wiring), `VAULT → KEYS →
  GUARDIANS`.

**Not built — stated plainly rather than left ambiguous:**
- The **24–48h recovery delay with a veto notification** (decision 3).
  Needs a background task and a local/push notification that survive the
  app being closed — real platform integration on iOS/Android that cannot
  be built or verified without a physical device.
- The **mobile PIN path** (decision 1's other half). The native key-store
  plugin (ticket 21) is now wired on iOS and Android — see "Decisions" below
  — but it releases the stored key on request, with no retry counter behind
  it yet; a PIN is not safe to ship until that counter exists, so passphrase
  stays the only unlock factor everywhere for now.
- The **five mock-up screens below are not pixel-matched.** The app has one
  working screen per flow (enroll, approve, restore), not yet the
  `CHOOSE GUARDIANS` / `DISTRIBUTING SHARES` / live per-guardian progress
  presentation this doc sketches — those were left as a UI pass, not a
  functional gap.
- Guardian storage does not yet switch protection together with
  `SECURITY`'s passphrase toggle; it is file-key-protected regardless of
  that setting today.

## Where things stand

`BlockchainBridge::load_identities` (`src/blockchain_bridge.rs`) already does the
right thing on startup:

```
vault has a key?  ──yes──>  use it, ask nothing
                  ──no───>  generate_new_identity()
                            └─ PrivateKeySigner::random()   (OS CSPRNG — correct)
                            └─ store in AES-256-GCM vault
```

That behaviour is kept. It is deliberately zero-friction: **no seed-phrase
ceremony, no quiz, no onboarding wall.**

What is missing is everything around it:

- **No way to export the key.** `get_primary_private_key` went out with the
  `legacy` module (3e18664) and nothing replaced it. Grep the current command
  surface: there is no export, no import, no backup.
- **No recovery of any kind.** `Vault → KEYS` says so out loud:
  `RECOVERY PHRASE: NONE — NOT BACKED UP`.
- **Vault key is a plain file**, `0o600` (`src/vault_key.rs`), not held by any
  device key store.

Net effect today: **lose or wipe the device and the funds are gone, permanently,
with no recourse.** Anyone funding a current build is exposed to this. Fixing it
is more urgent than any feature in this document.

## Principle

> The user never invents key material. The machine generates it from a CSPRNG.
> The user's job is to *keep* access, not to *create* it.

Anything a human can memorise, a GPU can enumerate. Brain wallets — deriving a
key from personal answers, a memorable phrase, or an LLM conversation — have
been drained by bots for a decade. This is not a tunable trade-off; it is a
prohibition.

Two corollaries:

- **Never put a key or seed into an LLM prompt**, local models included. Prompts
  are logged (Ollama logs them), swapped to disk, and captured in crash dumps. A
  key that has touched a prompt is burned.
- **Never let an LLM generate a mnemonic.** Model output is not cryptographic
  randomness.

## Unlock — without biometrics

Biometrics are not the security boundary. The key store is. Face ID is only a
*gesture* that unlocks it, and it can be swapped for another gesture without
weakening anything. It is also, for a product whose pitch is "you are Nobody",
the most personally-identifying input available — worth avoiding on principle,
not only on preference.

Layered, so no single platform capability is required:

```
Layer 3 (optional):  biometric        ← pure shortcut, can be disabled entirely
Layer 2 (if present): device key store holds half the key   ← "something you have"
Layer 1 (always):     PIN or passphrase → Argon2id          ← "something you know"
```

The vault key is derived from **both halves**. A copied vault file is useless
without the device; a stolen device is useless without the PIN.

Platform constraints that force layer 1 to exist:

| Platform | Hardware-counted retry limit | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| iOS / Android | yes (Secure Enclave / StrongBox) — wired via the native keystore plugin, see decision 1 below | a 6-digit PIN is sufficient once the plugin also enforces a retry counter |
| macOS / Windows / Linux | no key store is wired for desktop | **passphrase required** — a PIN is brute-forceable once the file is copied |

Note the conditional. This table describes what each platform *offers*, and the
factor actually shipped is decided by what has been *wired* — see "Decided —
the layer-1 factor" below. Today that is a passphrase everywhere.

A 6-digit PIN has only 10⁶ combinations. It is safe *only* when a hardware
counter enforces the retry limit. Counting attempts in software is worthless:
the attacker copies the vault file to another machine where nothing counts.
The Secure Enclave and TPM entries for macOS/Windows are capability, not
plumbing: nothing in this codebase reaches them today (decision 1 below), so
they get the same answer as Linux until that changes.

## Mesh unlock

Optional, additive, opt-in. Uses the mesh itself as the authentication factor —
the one capability no other wallet has.

### Enrollment (once)

```
vault key VK ──Shamir(K=3, N=5)──> 5 shares
                                     │
   each share encrypted to that       │
   guardian's mesh public key         ▼
owner ──[EncShare_i]──BLE──> guardian_i

owner stores:      guardian list, K, N
owner does NOT store: the shares (storing them defeats the mechanism)
guardian stores:   {owner node id, encrypted share, enrolled_at}
```

Shares deliver opportunistically. A guardian out of range simply receives theirs
at the next contact; enrollment is usable as soon as K have landed.

### Unlock

```
owner ──[UnlockReq{nonce, signature}]──BLE──> mesh
                    │
                    ▼
guardian: prompt shown, a human presses approve
                    │
                    ▼
guardian ──[share, re-encrypted to nonce key]──> owner
                    │
    K shares ───────┴──> Shamir reconstruct VK
                         → open vault → sign
                         → wipe VK from memory after T minutes
```

**What actually shipped resolves a gap this sketch glosses over: how does
`UnlockReq` reach the right guardians when nobody's BLE identity survives a
restart?** `mesh.rs`'s own module doc is explicit that no durable
identifier — not a nickname, not a wallet address, not a guardian's public
key — may appear in a cleartext broadcast; a stable guardian identifier
would be exactly the tracking surface that rule exists to prevent. The
built version broadcasts one **unlinkable recognition tag per enrolled
guardian** — `hash(guardian's public key, this request's nonce)` — instead
of any identifier. Only a device that already holds the matching public key
from enrollment can recognise its own tag; nobody else, including another
guardian in the same broadcast, learns anything from it, and a guardian's
tag differs on every request even to the same owner. `share` in the third
line above is sealed to the owner's own enrollment-time public key rather
than "re-encrypted to nonce key" — the nonce's only job is producing the
tag; sealing is what protects the share in transit. See
`cabal_guardian::protocol`'s module docs for the full reasoning.

### What this does and does not protect

| Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Vault file copied to another machine | **Safe.** Shares live on other people's devices. |
| Shared or team wallet | **Works well.** Spending requires several people present. This is the strongest use case. |
| **Device stolen** | **Not protected.** The thief holds the genuine device; guardians see a familiar node and may approve. **A PIN is still required.** |
| K guardians collude, day-to-day unlock | **Safe.** They hold shares of the key but not the encrypted vault, which sits on the owner's device. Two independent compromises are needed. |
| K guardians collude, **recovery** | **Exposed.** Recovery by definition does not need the vault file. Mitigate with a 24–48h delay plus a notification the original device can veto, if it is still alive. |

Mesh unlock is a **layer, never a replacement for the PIN**. Without a PIN
fallback, travelling beyond guardian range bricks the wallet.

## Where AI belongs

The LLM works on *intent*, never on key material. Signing lives behind a
boundary it cannot cross.

```
   ┌──────────── AI (local Ollama) ────────────┐
   │  1. parse natural language → intent JSON  │
   │  2. recovery assistant (guided Q&A)       │
   │  3. risk warnings before signing          │
   └────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                    │ structured JSON only
                    ▼
   ┌──────────── Rust (hard boundary) ─────────┐
   │  validate → draft → REVIEW → auth → SIGN  │
   │  key in the key store; the LLM never      │
   │  reaches this side                        │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Item 2 is the underrated one. Recovery is when the user is most panicked, and
the flow branches too many ways to express as static UI. A conversation handles
it well:

> **User:** I lost my phone.
> **Assistant:** Do you still have a device signed into the same account? If so
> the wallet returns by itself. If not, you enrolled three guardians. You need
> two of them nearby with the app open. Who is closest?

An AI "interview" about wallet history may serve as a *secondary* signal to help
a guardian decide — never as the sole gate, and **never** as an input to key
derivation. That would be a brain wallet again.

Backup prompting should also be driven by risk rather than by an onboarding
checklist. Asking someone to secure an empty wallet gets a Skip; asking after
their first real deposit does not:

> Your wallet now holds real value but is only backed up on this device. Set up
> three guardians?

## Decisions

1. **Layer-1 factor: PIN or passphrase?** **A passphrase, on every platform,
   until a hardware retry counter is actually wired.** Not "PIN where
   hardware allows": that phrasing describes a capability this build does
   not have yet, and shipping a PIN whose safety depends on a store nobody
   has connected would be claiming the protection rather than having it.

The rule this follows: *a PIN is a passphrase with 10⁶ of entropy, and only a
hardware counter makes that survivable.* Counting attempts in software is
worthless once the file is copied — the attacker counts on their own machine,
where nothing refuses. So the factor is chosen by what is wired, not by what
the platform could in principle provide:

| Platform | Hardware retry counter wired today | Layer-1 factor |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | no | passphrase |
| Windows | no | passphrase |
| Linux | none exists | passphrase |
| iOS | no | passphrase |
| Android | no | passphrase |

Note what that column does and does not say. A **key store** is now wired on
Apple platforms and Android — see layer 2 — but a key store is not a retry
counter. The stored key is released without asking the user for anything,
which is what makes it exfiltration resistance rather than access control, and
therefore what leaves the entropy of layer 1 carrying the whole load. A PIN
becomes defensible on a platform the day that platform's store is asked for
*user presence*, not the day it is merely used.

A 6-digit PIN becomes available on a platform the day that platform's store is
connected with a counter, and not before. That is a per-platform unlock of a
feature, not a global switch.

### Key derivation

Argon2id, `m = 64 MiB`, `t = 3`, `p = 1`, 32-byte output, 16-byte random salt.

Chosen against this attacker: *someone holding a copy of the key file, running
offline on rented GPUs.* 64 MiB per guess is the parameter that hurts them —
memory hardness is what a GPU cannot parallelise cheaply — and it is small
enough to run on a phone without the OS killing the process.

The parameters live **in the envelope**, not in the binary, so they can be
raised later without orphaning a vault written under the old ones.

They are measured rather than assumed, and the measurement is a test rather
than a note in this document: the suite asserts the exact constants (so
weakening them is a deliberate edit, never a typo) and asserts that one
derivation completes within a ceiling on whatever platform is running the
tests. Running that suite on the slowest supported target is what "measured on
the slowest target" means in practice, and it keeps being true as the code
moves rather than being true once.

### Retries

Attempts are counted in a file beside the vault, and the count and the
next-permitted time both survive a process restart and a reboot. Backoff is
exponential, capped.

This is explicitly **not** a security control — see above, an attacker with the
file does not ask this app for permission. It exists to make an over-the-
shoulder or borrowed-device attempt tedious, and nothing more. The document
should not later be read as if software counting were the defence.

A wrong passphrase never destroys the vault. Wipe-on-failure turns a mistyped
character into permanent loss, and the threat it defends against — an attacker
with the file — was never going to type into this app anyway.

### When the passphrase is forgotten

**The wallet is gone, unless it was exported.** There is no reset, no recovery
question, no support path. Argon2id over a random salt is not reversible by the
people who wrote it.

This is why the export path is a prerequisite rather than a companion feature:
encrypting the key without shipping a way to take it off the device converts
"malware could read this" into "a forgotten word destroys this", which is a
worse failure because it has no attacker to blame and no one who can help.

### What this does not defend against

- **A device stolen while unlocked.** The secret has already been supplied.
- **Malware running as the same user while the app is unlocked.** It does not
  need the key file; it can ask the running process. The passphrase closes the
  at-rest hole, not the running-process one.
- **A keylogger.** It captures the passphrase as it is typed.
- **Screen capture** of the export screen.

Layer 2 is what narrows the first two, which is why it is a separate ticket and
not a footnote here.

### Rejected

- **PIN everywhere.** 10⁶ offline guesses at 64 MiB each is still a weekend on
  rented hardware, and it would be sold to the user as equivalent security.
- **PIN where the hardware exists, passphrase elsewhere** — the original
  proposal. Right in principle and wrong to implement first: it makes the
  strength of the product depend on a store that is not yet connected, and it
  splits the unlock code into two paths before either has run in anger.
- **No layer 1, hardware only.** On every desktop store that unlocks per
  session, any process running as the user can ask for the item. That is the
  hole being fixed, not a fix for it.
- **Deriving the vault key from the wallet key.** Then the vault protects
  nothing: whoever reads it already has what it protects.

2. **Default K/N: 3-of-5, not user-configurable in v1.** In plain terms:
   pick 5 guardians up front; any 3 of them, together, can unlock the
   wallet; the other 2 can be offline, travelling, or simply asleep and it
   still works. Concretely — Alice enrolls Bob, Carol, Dan, Eve, and Frank.
   Bob and Carol are out of Bluetooth range this week. Dan, Eve, and Frank
   are in range: that's 3, so Alice unlocks normally, and Bob/Carol's shares
   simply catch up next time they're near her. The reason for 3-of-5 rather
   than something tighter: shares deliver opportunistically (see
   Enrollment above), so *some* guardians being unreachable at any given
   moment is the normal case, not the exception — a scheme that needed all
   5 present would fail most unlock attempts in practice. The reason it
   isn't looser (say, 2-of-5): raising K also raises how many guardians
   would have to collude to reconstruct the key behind the owner's back —
   2-of-5 means any pair of guardians is a risk, 3-of-5 means it takes three
   agreeing. K/N stays fixed rather than a setting in v1 because letting
   users pick it opens a second problem — re-enrollment when a guardian is
   dropped, partially-delivered share sets, users picking an unsafe K — that
   the first release doesn't need to solve to prove the mechanism works.
3. **Delay on recovery: 24 hours, waived when the vault is empty.** Recovery
   (a brand-new device reconstructing the key from guardians) is different
   from ordinary unlock (an already-trusted device asking guardians to
   approve) — recovery is the case a stolen-but-still-alive original device
   cannot simply refuse from its own unlock screen, so it needs its own
   safety net. Concretely: a thief with Bob's stolen phone contacts 3 of his
   5 guardians and asks to "restore." Instead of handing over the
   reconstructed key immediately, the app holds it for 24 hours and fires a
   notification to Bob's *original* device, if that device is still alive
   somewhere with a network connection: "a restore is in progress — cancel
   it if this isn't you." If Bob still has the phone (or any signed-in
   device) and did not initiate this, he taps cancel and the thief gets
   nothing despite having fooled 3 guardians. If Bob genuinely lost every
   device, nothing can veto, and the wait is simply the cost of the safety
   net — 24 hours, not 48, because doubling the wait doesn't make a
   nonexistent veto more likely to arrive; it only makes the honest,
   device-lost case slower. The wait is skipped entirely when the vault
   holds nothing worth stealing (below a dust threshold), for the same
   reason backup prompts are deferred for an empty wallet elsewhere in this
   doc: a delay defends value, and there's none to defend yet.
